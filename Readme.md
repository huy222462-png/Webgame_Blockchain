IMPORTANT: database credentials were previously committed here. Those lines have been removed for security.
Please create a `.env` file at the project root with your MongoDB connection string. Example in `.env.example`.

If a password or URI was leaked, rotate the credential immediately (change the user's password or create a new DB user) and do not commit secrets to the repo.
